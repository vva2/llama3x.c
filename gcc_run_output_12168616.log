When he got home, he told his wife and son about his problem. They both tried to water the seeds, but they still didn't take. Finally, John's wife said, "I know what we can do. We'll go to the store and buy some water." So they went to the store and bought some water. When they got home, they put the water in a bucket and poured it on the seeds. The seeds started to grow, and soon they were big and healthy. John's wife and son were so happy that they decided to plant more seeds.
