once upon a time there was a king who had a beautiful daughter. The king was very proud of his daughter and wanted to marry her to a prince who was as handsome as she was beautiful. The king sent out a proclamation that any prince who could defeat him in a game of chess would be allowed to marry his daughter. Many princes came to the castle to try their luck, but none of them could defeat the king. One day, a young prince named Jack arrived at the castle. He was a skilled chess player and he knew that he had a chance to win the game. He sat down at the chessboard and began to play. The king was surprised to see that Jack was a good player, but he was determined to win. He made a move and Jack countered it. The king made another move and Jack countered it again. The game went on like this for a while, with each player making a move and the other player countering it. Finally, the king made a move that Jack couldn't counter. He was defeated and the king declared that Jack could marry his daughter. Jack was overjoyed and he and the princess lived happily ever after.
